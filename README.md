Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning to classify sonar data, distinguishing between rocks and mines. Leveraging sonar data's capabilities for underwater object detection, the goal is to develop a reliable binary classification model.

Objective:
The model, trained on a dataset of features extracted from sonar signals, aims to accurately predict whether detected objects are rocks or mines. Performance evaluation is based on standard accuracy metrics.

Potential Applications:
Underwater navigation and security.

Methodology:

1. Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality and consistency.
2. Data Preprocessing: Transforming data for optimal model performance.
3. Model Training and Evaluation: Comparing classification algorithms and assessing accuracy.
